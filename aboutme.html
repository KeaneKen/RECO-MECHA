                        Yo! You can call me Keane, let’s start by knowing who i am. I was born in Makassar at 11th of March 2006. The reason of why this website exists is of my Gunpla Addiction tbh, it all started during the first semester holiday at my college, i started looking into these things called “Figure-Rise Standard”, mainly because of their Kamen Rider Figures, but while i was looking, i noticed these things called “Entry Grade” Gunplas which are basically Gunpla kits specifically made to have a pretty simple build and requiring no tools, and also their price are really affordable too! So because my budget isn't enough for Figure-Rise, i kinda just said "you know what, i think I'm just gonna buy some of the Entry Grades since these are way more affordable, and I'm pretty new to this hobby anyways so i should try it out first", the ones i got are Entry Grade Nu Gundam, RX 78-2, and Strike Gundam, and honestly even though the plastics are kinda brittle, the building experience were amazing, the pieces just snap together so well, and getting to the final result felt really good, and i wasn't satisfied lol, so i ended up buying two more Entry Grades, those are the LAH Gundam and Strike Exceed Galaxy. After finishing my Entry Grade collection, i'm starting to look into gundam more and watched one of their most recent series "The Witch From Mercury", and it was alright, but what peak my interest was the Mobile Suit designs, they were pretty awesome! So then I've decided to collect The Witch From Mercury lines as up next for my collection. As i started collecting, i noticed the price of these Gundams are pretty inconsistent, some are way more expensive than others, especially the more popular ones, and it was pretty though to find an online store that sell these at a reasonable price. So that's how i got my idea for this website, i want a website that can find a reasonable price for the Gunplas you seek from some reputable stores (Reco-Mecha is an amalgamation of the words Recommendation and Mecha).
                    <p>
                      When I'm not coding or crafting, I enjoy listening to music and exploring sci-fi mecha lore.
